page. 

If you have installed Django in your machine and want to test the
website, please modify the following settings in file
cst25/settings.py:

# Modification One:
ADMINS = (
       # Do not modify my information, but you should add your
       information. Like this:
       ('Your Name', 'Your Email Address'),
)

# Modification Two:
DATABASE = {
	 'default' : {
	 	   'NAME': 'The absolute path of file db', 
		   # For example, '/home/sb/websites/cst25/db'
		   # Or 'C:/users/sb/jobs/cst25/db'. Even in Windows, 
		   # you should use slash '/' rather than backslash
		   # '\'. 
		   # 'db' is the file in the root directory of cst25.
		   # You can see it.
	 }
}

# Modification Three:
MEDIA_ROOT = '<The absolute path of directory media/>'
# The rules is like NAME in DATABASE.
# And do not omit / at the end.

# Modification Four:

# Modification Five:
STATICFILES_DIRS = (
# Directories should be modified.
)


# If you are Li Haoda or StrengthMan, you should create a superuser
# for yourself, too.
